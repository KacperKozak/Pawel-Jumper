Guidelines for CHANGELOG entries

- Only include user-facing changes. Exclude refactors, internal utilities, and test-only updates.
- Wrap code identifiers, functions, and commands in backticks, e.g., `cn()`, `EnvKind`, `ChunkKind`.
- Prefer concise bullets. Avoid implementation detail.
- Group multiple items under one version chronologically.
- Treat commits whose subject is just a version like `v2.x.x` as bump commits; to find changes, look at the previous commit.

Examples

- Good:
    - Add: Detect and handle class lists in React props (className strings and `cn()` calls)
        - e.g. `className="p-2 bg-white text-sm"`, `className={cn("p-2 bg-white", isActive && "text-blue-600")}`
    - Fix: Preserve cursor column after horizontal moves in arrays/objects/unions/JSX
    - Add: Simple environment support â€” reorder plain words/identifiers in non-bracketed text
        - e.g. `alpha beta gamma`, `user.profile.name`
- Bad:
    - Refactor: Split `detector.ts` into helpers
    - Tests: Update unit tests for splitter
    - Chore: Move types to `src/types/`
